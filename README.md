This repository contains code and data for Chung et al., "Intersecting memories of immunity and climate: Potential multiyear impacts of the El Niño—Southern Oscillation on infectious disease spread."

The code is in 2 parts:
1. SIRS-ENSO model (seasonal and biennial)
* Runs the SIRS model
* Generates the SIRS model output
* Analyzes and plots the data
2. Weather data-SIRS model (HCoV-HKU1, forced by MERRA2 weather data)
* Code runs the SIRS model (using MERRA2 data)
* Code analyzes and plots the data

The data from the SIRS model (#1) output is provided in the data/ folder. The data from the Weather data-SIRS model (#2) is available for download on tigress. **INSERT LINK**
