This repository contains code and data for Chung et al., "Intersecting memories of immunity and climate: Potential multiyear impacts of the El Niño—Southern Oscillation on infectious disease spread."

The code is in 2 parts:
1. SIRS-ENSO model (seasonal and biennial)
* Runs the SIRS model
* Generates the SIRS model output
* Analyzes and plots the data
2. MERRA-2/SIRS model (HCoV-HKU1, forced by MERRA-2 specific humidity data)
* Runs the HCoV-HKU1 SIRS model
* Analyzes and plots the data

The data from the SIRS model (#1) output and the MERRA-2/SIRS model (#2) are provided in the data/ folder.
